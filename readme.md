This Git Repository will cover the lessons and projects that can be found within London App Brewery's Webdevelopment course. 

Additionally, this will be my playground to test out git functionality, figure out branching, merges, PRs etc.


This includes JS, HTML, CSS and a whole bunch of other stuff. The gitignore will contain any files with sensetive information - any cloud DB access keys etc. 

Any API keys that you can find in the files will have been deactivated or are from Free APIs. 

If you're looking to follow along or just interested in the course itself, ping me and I'd be happy to have a chat.
